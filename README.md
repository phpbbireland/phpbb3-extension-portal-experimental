# phpbb3-extension-portal-experimental
This is an experimental version of my phpbb3-extension-portal for teasing only.  

**Please do not install this version as it will probably break your site.**

The process of updating phpBB modification to extensions is complex and requires a good working knowledge of Opp's / Classes which I have been reluctant to learn for many years. Even after several months studying, I don't understand some of the basics and symfony code has lefts me questioning my intelligence...

The code in this repo is my attempts at updating the portal code to a class based extension by examining extensions code from authors who have superior knowledge of the subject... Learning by example is fine but I still need to know why and not just how...

I am reluctant to ask for assistance/help as I do not want to be nuisance or appear ignorant... nevertheless I am ignorant of opps and classes and will make many mistakes...
Mike
