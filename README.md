# phpbb3-extension-portal-experimental
This is an experimental version of my phpbb3-extension-portal for teasing only.  

**Please do not install this version as it will probably break your site.**

The process of updating phpBB modification to extensions is complex and requires a good working knowledge of Opp's / Classes which I have been reluctant to learn for many years. Even after several months studying, I don't understand some of the basics and symfony code has lefts me questioning my intellect...

The code in this repo is my attempts at updating the portal code to a class based extension by examining extensions code from authors who have superior knowledge of the subject. The learning by example is the first step in the process but I'm struggling with the why opposed to how...

That being said, I have some knowledge of classes and oop's, enough to get myself into trouble anyway, but not quite enough to find my way out. I'm guessing the same could be said for many of us...
